# 2048

for this project I wanted to build a fondation to pave the way for BDD + TDD. It's my first ever solo project. As well as my first ever project with ReactJS, Typescript, Vite, Cucumber and Playwright !

I decided to cheat a little and build the app before writing the test cases. Not very TDD of me, I know ! Doing it full on without knowing any of the tools and libraries I would use felt like too big of a mountain to climb.

All things considered, I'm overall happy with the result.

I fought a lot trying to make fluent 2 work and gave up. I ended up using fluent ui but I don't think I'll keep using it.

Making cucumber work with typescript was also painful for some reason.

And since I work from a codespace, managing to pass 2FA in my E2E tests was quite the challenge.

I went way too low level in my BDD scenarios, it forced me to have an "edit board" mode for my "Given the board is ..." scenarios.

I terms of packages and app architecture, I have no idea what I'm doing !

I'm still a wizard's apprentice, time for my next challenge !
