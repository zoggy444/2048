# My personal playground

This repo is a place for me to practice development. I have a few years of experience being a mostly javascript developer on odoo 10.

After a 1 year break from development I decided to get back into it. I followed the official React website's tutorial and watched a few videos about typescript. In parallel I studied and got an ISTQB Test Automation Engineer certification. I looked into BDD, TDD. I looked into different test automation tools and decided I wanted to go with playwright. It is said to have quite the steep learning curve but I'm up for the task !
